one-pagers
==========

This project is a loose collection of single-page self-contained JSP files that make your life easier when troubleshooting issues. 

These files will obviously get no love from your info-sec team! In most cases, it should be fine if you put them all under some protected URI (e.g. /admin/\*) - but please exercise your judgement in how you plan on using/deploying them.
